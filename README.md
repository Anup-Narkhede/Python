# Python Program

1. Program to check whether a natural number entered by user is an odd or even number.


2. Program to Check whether given number is palindrome or not. [Check reverse and original no are same or not]. e.g 145


3. Program to check Perfect number. 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 [Perfect number is a positive integer that is the sum of its proper positive divisors]


4. Program to check Strongnumber.eg.145=>1!+4!+5!=1+24+120=145[Strong no = The sum of the factorials of digits of a number is equal to the original number.]


5. Program to check Armstrong number. 153 => 1^3 + 5^3 +3^3 = 1+125+27= 153 [The sum of the cubes of digits of a number is equal to the original number.]


6. Program to print prime numbers between limits defined by user [eg. 1 to 100 = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97)
